For these labs i used emacs, racket, and geiser these are availalble thrue 
apt-get in ubuntu.

;;added this so emacs will turn on scheme-mode when .ss file is opened
(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.ss" . scheme-mode))))	   
   
;;hmm i thought this would start repl automatically look up again
(setq geiser-mode-start-repl-p t)
;;this causes to start geiser mode at when scheme-mode is turned on
(require 'geiser-mode)
(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'turn-on-geiser-mode)


;;to start up  REPL (the interactive prompt) 
M-x run-racket
M-x run-geiser
followed by racket or geiser or other implementation

;;to turn on trace use the following in interpeter prompt
(require racket/trace)
(trace expression)

;;In lab2 need to keep re-evalute streams to work
