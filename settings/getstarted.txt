For these labs i used emacs, racket, and geiser these are availalble thrue 
apt-get in ubuntu.

;;added this so emacs will turn on scheme-mode when .ss file is opened
(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.ss" . scheme-mode))))	      
;;this causes to start geiser mode at when scheme-mode is turned on
(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook '(lambda () (geiser-mode)))
;;to start up  REPL (the interactive prompt) 
M-x run-racket
M-x run-geiser
followed by racket or geiser or other implementation
